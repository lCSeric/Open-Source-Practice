Please download the XAMPP
Open the xampp and start the function of apache and MySQL
open the admin in the row of Mysql(That website is your database)
press the CREATE at the left side of column and name the database 'credit_caculation'(not credit_calculation)

download these three codes which are database.php and index.html and script.js from github
put those code in a file(we suggest the file name as easy as possible not to use space or symbol, we name the file 'opensoft')
put that file into htdocs which is in the xampp file (default file path is 'C:\xampp\htdocs')

open a new website and enter URL 'localhost/(the file name)/index.html'(if you name the file same as us , your URL will be "localhost/opensoft/index.html")
you will see a website have the function we mention
